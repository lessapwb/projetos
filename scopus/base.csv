A successful business strategy requires a raising awareness about the external environment of organizations, including customers, competitors, industry structure and competitive forces. In this context, we intend to develop a research framework that can assist decision makers in emerging economies. The proposed framework was evaluated by a expert panel, for that, it was applied the Delphi methodology to assess the framework. We hope that this research will be considered as a contribution to a better understanding of the application of Marketing Intelligence in Pervasive Business Intelligence systems, which will enable organizations can achieve and maintain a competitive advantage. © Research India Publications.;"Business intelligence; Marketing intelligence; Pervasive business intelligence; Pervasive marketing intelligence";Research India Publications;9734562;English;Int.

Therefore, this research aims to investigate the impact of success factors on the implementation of business intelligence in SMEs. A case study of Lagos State, Nigeria, is utilised for this study. A quantitative research method was used with the sample size of 165 respondents from the employees who used business intelligence in SMEs. The data obtained were analysed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The findings of this study revealed that there are some key success factors such as knowledge management, technology orientation, market intelligence, and orientation and entrepreneurial orientation, which affect business intelligence implementation in SMEs. The other factors such as the organisational resources, management structure, and organisational culture were found to be insignificant success factors for the implementation of business intelligence in SMEs. This study provides an insightful understanding of the key success factors for business intelligence implementation which has an impact on business outcomes. The findings of this study will assist entrepreneurs and academicians to construct a business intelligence system that can improve overall organisational efficiency in an ever-changing economic environment. The implementation of a successful business intelligence will aid decision-making, promote economic development for businesses, foster innovation in firms, and increase company performance and productivity, all of which are part of the core sustainable development goals such as SDG 8 and SDG 9. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;"Business intelligence; Organisational factors; Orientation factors; Small- and medium-sized enterprises; Success factors";Springer;1868-7865;English;J.

Outlines the firm's divisions, business activities and client base. Explains in detail how the firm uses business research, covering use of market intelligence on the business issues that an individual client faces, and the gathering of intelligence about the client, to disclose the nature and extent of the firm's ambitions to advise the organization concerned. Discusses the staffing of a law firm's business research capability, pointing out that not only staff expertise but also confidentiality concerns mean that it is not always efficient for lawyers to access internal and external information sources directly. Suggests that defining the minimum business research necessary improves the usefulness of the information delivered and saves the firm time - and that removing the uncertainty about what is required improves job satisfaction as well.

This platform integrates a combination of established AI technologies - i.e. semantic models, natural language processing, and inference engines - in a novel way. We present two prototype corporate radars built using this platform: the Business Event Advisor, which detects threats and opportunities relevant to a decision maker's organization, and the Technology Investment Radar which assesses the maturity of technologies that impact a decision maker's business. The Technology Investment Radar has been piloted with business users, and we present encouraging initial results from this pilot. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.

Many strategies are based on business intelligence (BI) and marketing intelligence (MI) that make it possible to extract profitable knowledge and insights from large amounts of data generated by company customers in digital environments. In this context, the present study proposes a three-step research methodology based on data text mining (DTM). In further research, this methodology can be used for business intelligence analysis (BIA) strategies to analyze user generated content (UGC) in social networks and on digital platforms. The proposed methodology unfolds in the following three stages. First, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that determines the database topic is used. Second, a sentiment analysis (SA) is proposed. This SA is applied to the LDA results to divide the topics identified in the sample into three sentiments. Thirdly, textual analysis (TA) with data text mining techniques is applied on the topics in each sentiment. The proposed methodology offers important advances in data text mining in terms of accuracy, reliability and insight generation for both researchers and practitioners seeking to improve the BIA processes in business and other sectors. © 2019 by the authors.;"Business intelligence; Data text mining; Marketing intelligence; Sentiment analysis";MDPI AG;20738994;English;Symmetry;Final;Scopus;"Cited by: 55; All Open Access, Gold Open Access, Green Open Access";10.3390/sym11040519;"J.R.

Business intelligence, competitive intelligence and marketing intelligence are the management tools used to mine information to produce up-to-date intelligence and knowledge for operative and strategic decision making. A structured questionnaire is used for the study. A total of 300 mines are randomly selected from a research population of mining organizations in South Africa, Africa and globally. The respondents are all part of senior management. A response rate of 64% is achieved. The results indicat that more than half of the respondents do not have real-time intelligence and proper data mining tools to identify patterns and relationships within a data warehouse. Although a large proportion agrees that their organizations have systematic ways of gathering these different types of intelligence and use them for strategic decision making, there is a significant proportion that did not have any systems. Statistically and practically significant positive relationships with a large effect are found among the dimensions of business intelligence, marketing intelligence, competitive intelligence and perceived business performance. © Dinko Herman Boikanyo, Ronnie Lotriet, Pieter W.

At the beginning of the 90s, even though the Intelligence Community experienced a crisis due to the end of the Cold war, business intelligence emerged as a promising market for many young retired intelligence officers. Business intelligence (BI) would become a new field of expertise as far as it was possible to transfer their knowledge (intelligence tradecraft) into the world of trade competitiveness. IC has become a paradigm for BI students who now learn it as well as a methodological, functional and organizational tool. The appropriation of this « Swiss knife » concept is supposed to give them the keys of BI, as the heart of information generation and flow sharing engine. However, if we consider the origin of IC, we can say that its transfer has been based on a partial interpretation of the military model. This could explain, from our point of view, the difficulty encountered by the firms to make it effective in a BI process. Moreover, we suppose that a wrong adaptation or a misunderstanding of the model could have bad consequences on the information and knoivledge management. The purpose of this article is to develop a critical approach of IC applied to intelligence tradecraft and BI. We propose to study the intelligence process through IC model in order to define the limits in which it can be effective and useful, among others for marketing intelligence. © Editions ESKA 2006.;"Business intelligence; Information and knowledge management; Intelligence analysis; Intelligence cycle";null;17793572;French;Mark.

To this end, organizations are developing capabilities around intelligence. From the organizational point of view, intelligence in business is a relatively new field study, so it is convenient to know and understand what the main themes are and their evolution in order to facilitate their integration. Taking this into account, the current research conducts a conceptual and structural analysis of the Journal of Intelligence Studies in Business (JISIB). JISIB is one of the few academic journals devoted purely to publishing articles about business intelligence, collective intelligence, competitive intelligence, economic intelligence, market intelligence, marketing intelligence, scientific and technical intelligence, strategic intelligence, and their equivalent terms in other languages. This analysis is carried out by quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, identifying the main authors and evaluating the development of the main themes within it using SciMAT as a bibliometric analysis software. To this purpose, the documents published in JISIB from 2011 to 2017 were retrieved from two different sources: the JISIB official web page and the Web of Science. In this way, the bibliometric performance analysis evaluates the impact of the scientific output based on publications and their citations, while science mapping illustrates the intellectual structure of the journal and the evolution of the main research themes. Bearing in mind that JISIB provides an open platform for the publication of original research articles, opinion articles, book reviews and conference proceedings about the intelligence field, this research allows to understand its structure and evolution and all the themes associated with it. It provides a framework to support intelligence researchers and professionals in the development and direction of future research by identifying emerging, transversal, core and declining themes. Finally, this study includes a performance analysis of JISIB. © 2018 Halmstad University.;"Business intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Conceptual evolution map; Coword analysis; Science mapping analysis";Halmstad University;2001015X;English;J.

Through a descriptive literature review, it was possible to find the conceptual and methodological similarities and differences, as well as the most applied technological tools from research for a better understanding of these disciplines and the opportunity to integrate them, generating and taking advantage of the potential of each one to different business applications. With the exponential growth of data and information from different sources that need to be processed by organizations, it is concluded that integrating these concepts of intelligence from data analysis may be an opportunity. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Existing social media analytics frameworks do not deliver benchmarks that permit businesses to relate customer sentiment on social media to easily know where businesses are doing good and where they need to develop, Also current social media analytics framework does not consider all the reviews for analysis, if the reviews and tweets are in another language then existing system does not consider them for analysis purpose, so whatever result comes, in the end, is not accurate. This paper present a social media competitive analytics framework that can be used to gather industry-specific marketing intelligence and by using Microsoft language translator the paper can convert other languages reviews and tweet into English language so whatever the result came, in the end, is definitely more accurate than the current system because this paper considers all the reviews for the analysis. Based on the idea of the proposed framework, new social media competitive analytics with sentiment benchmarks can be industrialized to improve marketing intelligence and to recognize specific areas in which businesses are leading and lagging, By using proposed framework, The paper present an innovative business-driven social media competitive analytics tool to analyze tweets associated with food companies and to make meaningful business reports. © International Science Press.;"Classifiers; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Topic modelling";Serials Publications;9745572;English;Int.

Design/methodology/approach: Following a comprehensive literature review, the data mining concept was investigated through a workshop with industry experts and academics. Findings: The results showed that the key drivers for using data mining within the AEC sector is associated with the sustainability, process improvement, market intelligence, cost certainty and cost reduction, performance certainty and decision support systems agendas in the sector. As for the processes with the greatest potential for data mining application, design, construction, procurement, forensic analysis, sustainability and energy consumption and reuse of digital components were perceived as the main process areas. While the key challenges were perceived as being, data issues due to the fragmented nature of the construction process, the need for a cultural change, IT systems used in silos, skills requirements and having clearly defined business goals. Originality/value: With the increasing abundance of data, business intelligence and analytics and its related concepts, data mining and Big Data have captured the attention of practitioners and academics for the last 20 years. On the other hand, and despite the growing amount of data in its business context, the AEC sector still lags behind in utilising those concepts in its end products and daily operations with limited research conducted to explore those issues at the sector level. This paper investigates the main opportunities and barriers for data mining in the AEC sector with a practical focus. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Decision support systems; Information and communication technology (ICT) applications; Technology";EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;0969-9988;English;Eng.

Findings show there were few limits or restrictions on what kind of data users could imagine buying or renting, if all types of data were available. Data that is more sensitive-personal data and private data-will be difficult to buy, users think. Company secrets and most data for business-to-business (B2B) industries is especially difficult to obtain. The major concerns for DaaS from a user perspective are confidentiality, quality, reliability, security and accessibility. Besides, it is often pointed out by users that when everyone has much of the same data competition will increase. Users want to see more on company metrics, less expensive, more secure and more flexible data solutions. The analysis reveals that the ethical dimension are a major concern as DaaS develops.

This practice-oriented article on the deployment and impact of BI tools in industry suggests a balanced scorecard (BSC) approach to performance management. More specifically, a suite of web 2.0 tools is used in the practice of BI and their impact measured with a BSC. Design/methodology/approach: The research proposition is that the effectiveness of BI is indeed strategic and relates to its corporate performance. This claim is validated using a global information technology consultancy firm's BI unit as the lead case of an immersive field study. Research engagements with four other firms provide corroborative support. Findings: The BSC approach to deriving targets and ascertaining outcomes was shown to be applicable to good practice. The converse is equally valid. That is, strategic performance management requires the use of BI in order to be sound. Therefore, tools such as web 2.0 and data analytics, must be outcome driven with planned targets identified. Practical implications: BI is a necessary activity for deriving improved performance. It aids in the identification of a firm's knowledge strengths, as well as gaps with respect to its environment. The key message to executives is that Peter Drucker was right - we cannot manage what we do not measure! Originality/value: The use of BI as a strategic knowledge management technique is a composite of a host of web 2.0 tools. It does not stand in isolation from other initiatives for exploiting knowledge in order to drive performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Balanced scorecard; Knowledge management; Knowledge management systems; Marketing intelligence; Organizational performance";null;14741032;English;VINE;Final;Scopus;"Cited by: 39; All Open Access, Green Open Access";10.1108/03055721111134772;"R.

A café-restaurant, serving mid-low customers, is the restaurant. For this restaurant, a clear marketing strategy has never been the main problem. Promotions implemented to the degree that they are not based on a campaign are not targeted and have no impact on revenue. The use of business intelligence from Power Market Intelligence (Power BI) will be a way of predicting customer consumption patterns for restaurants. However, with Market Basket Analysis they also model the demand trend. Captured service consumer consumption patterns used for the implementation of a 4P (product, location, price or promotion) framework for the proper marketing strategy. Some of the restaurant menus have been found to have a unique relationship and can be used for the promotion of profits. Certain findings cover child and office employees in the business category. This data is enabled with the Power BI dashboard, which will allow the review of improvements in revenue by the restaurant's managers based on events and activities. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

The time series econometric analyses was used to estimate market integration, price transmission, and price volatility happening in the major domestic markets for one of the imported pulses namely green gram. The time-series data pertained to prices of a green gram for the major markets are sourced from 2006 to 2018 on a monthly frequency. Further, the vertical integration among the production and consumption markets were also studied using these analyses. In order to remove the non-stationarity element in the price series, the ADF test was used, which were non-stationary at levels but became stationary at the first difference. The price volatility prevailing in the green gram markets of India was estimated by GARCH (1,1) model revealed that all the markets were exhibiting consistent variability in market prices. Among these markets, there existed bi-directional causation which was confirmed by the Granger Causality test. The presence of three co-integration vectors for these markets proved the existence of a long-run equilibrium for green gram prices. Tamil Nadu market came under short-run equilibrium whereas remaining markets had long-run equilibrium estimated by VECM. Retail prices of Madurai market had bi-directional price influence with Tamil Nadu market. Hence it is suggested that better price discovery and timely market intelligence would be necessary to manage the price shocks occurring in the green gram markets in India. © 2020 The Society of Economics and Development.;"Co-integration; Green gram; Markets; Price volatility; Vector correction";The Society of Economics and Development;2277-5412;English;Indian J.

While busesinss-to-business (B2B) technology solutions, such as CPFR (collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment), facilitate the sharing of historical information (e.g., transaction records), business intelligence (e.g., potential customer demand) is considered private. Central to CPFR is collaborative demand forecasting (CDF) that allows supply chain partners to share private demand information and incorporate the jointly derived demand forecast into production planning and product replenishment decisions. Implementing CDF, however, is a challenge because of the high costs of the laborious collaboration effort (e.g., to resolve forecast differences). Hence, companies are unable to realize the benefits of CDF and, in turn, the full potential of CPFR. Typically, the issues of information truthfulness and collaboration cost are addressed through an exception management mechanism that defines a range of forecast updates within which collaboration is automated without any human intervention in B2B trading partners. In this paper, we develop incentive-based contracts that explicitly consider the truth-telling behavior and exception resolution in decisions related to the threshold values of demand information. Our first contribution to B2B information management is in establishing the strategic value of exception management and resolution mechanisms in B2B relationships, leading to truthful revelation of demand information. Our second contribution is in developing exception-based incentive contracts, especially in light of the advances in today's business practices and technology, to address issues associated with unobservable and asymmetric demand information. Specifically, we propose a resolution contract to coordinate the supply chain that directly incorporates both exceptions and resolution in an incentive mechanism. We show that these alternative contracts are all viable solutions in assuring truthful exchange of demand information but excel individually in specific situations and, thus, provide practitioners with alternative demand collaboration tools when price negotiation is not an option. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;"B2B commerce; collaborative commerce; collaborative demand forecasting; collaborative planning; exception-based incentive mechanism; forecasting and replenishment; information sharing; supply chain management";M E SHARPE INC;0742-1222;English;J Manage Inf Syst;Final;Scopus;Cited by: 8;10.2753/MIS0742-1222310209;null;"Commerce; Forecasting; Information analysis; Information management; Production control; Supply chain management; B2B commerces; Collaborative commerce; Collaborative planning; Demand forecasting; Incentive mechanism; Information sharing; Information dissemination";null;JMISE;FAL;80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA;Dong, Y (Corresponding Author), Univ S Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.

The paper examines the role of business and market intelligence in expediting service innovation and responsiveness in Malaysia, which is considered the business hub of Asia. Primary survey data were collected from the 93 managerial staff of postal and courier companies in Malaysia. We employed PLS-SEM methodology to test the relationship between the selected variables of interest. The results indicate that market intelligence and business intelligence are the major contributors to service innovation and service responsiveness. Moreover, the role of knowledge management is crucial in better utilization of external and internal knowledge. Finally, this study provides practical guidelines to practitioners and policymakers of postal and courier companies to devise viable strategies for efficiently realizing service innovation and service responsiveness to the best satisfaction of the end customers. © The Author(s) 2023.;"Business intelligence; Knowledge management; Market intelligence; Postal and courier services; Service innovation; Service responsiveness";Springer Science and Business Media B.V.;335177;English;Qual.

Respondents in the survey defined the scope to include analysis, traditional phenomena or problems, new phenomena, trans- or cross disciplinary studies, methodological issue and industry specific studies. Respondents were also asked to come up with terms for a good definition of the study. We found that existing definitions of CI in use are overlapping with definitions of other more established fields of study, like decision sciences and marketing intelligence. Respondents agreed that it's practical to define the study in terms of understanding the external environment. In the discussion a parallel is made to the notion of surrounding world analysis and Stevan Dedijer's ideas about social intelligence. A broad discussion leads to a renewed interest for disciplines studied by the humanities as we show what has been lost in the development of the social sciences.

These systems permit firms to better tailor their offerings, to increase market intelligence and achieve increased competency in the markets where they operate. Unfortunately, the ratio of CRM failures to CRM successes exceeds 2-1; little is known about why such an important customer support utility might be so seemingly ineffective because there are few studies that deal with CRM failures and the factors leading to or preventing success. Utilizing a grounded theory methodology, this article spans the disciplines of marketing and information systems in the process of inducing the reasons for CRM failure and success. Results indicate that implementation factors play a significant role in CRM outcomes. © 2014 IEEE.";"Business intelligence; collaborative tools; collaborative work; management information systems; market research; organizational aspects; social computing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;2329-924X;English;IEEE Trans.

The most important megatrend is the digitalisation, which triggers a whole new economic revolution, so called ‘fourth industrial revolution’. In the situation with the new data source, new technological means for harvesting and processing of data, digitalisation and fourth economic revolution is very relevant not only for the operation but the marketing function as well. Social media represent an excellent source of data and channel of communication with the customer. Marketing spending on digital media platform soon will be no. 1, and it will overtake TV as the dominant marketing channel. Introducing the big data analytical capabilities, adjustment of overall organisation scheme and hiring competent personnel, the company will be in a position to save money for marketing spending, but in same time overall marketing performances will increase. Introducing big data analytical capabilities and efficient use of available social media platform is a challenging task that lay ahead of senior executives. Support from the highest management instances is the critical preconditions in reaching desired outcomes in the possible synergy between big data (BD) and social media marketing (SMM).

This state of affairs draws from two different scientific communities (informatics and business) that have generated multiple research streams, which duplicate research, neglect each other’s contributions and overlook important research gaps. In response, the authors structure the BI scientific landscape and map its evolution to offer scholars a clear view of where research on BI stands and the way forward. For this endeavor, the authors systematically review articles published in top-tier ABS journals and identify 120 articles covering 35 years of scientific research on BI. The authors then run a co-citation analysis of selected articles and their reference lists. This yields the structuring of BI scholarly community around six research clusters: environmental scanning (ES), competitive intelligence (CI), market intelligence (MI), decision support (DS), analytical technologies (AT) and analytical capabilities (AC). The co-citation network exposed overlapping and divergent theoretical roots across the six clusters and permitted mapping the evolution of BI research following two pendulum swings. This study aims to contribute by structuring the theoretical landscape of BI research, deciphering the theoretical roots of BI literature, mapping the evolution of BI scholarly community and suggesting an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper follows a systematic methodology to isolate peer-reviewed papers on BI published in top-tier ABS journals. Findings: The authors present the structuring of BI scholarly community around six research clusters: ES, CI, MI, DS, AT and AC. The authors also expose overlapping and divergent theoretical roots across the six clusters and map the evolution of BI following two pendulum swings. In light of the structure and evolution of the BI research, the authors offer a future research agenda for BI research. Originality/value: This study contributes by elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of the BI literature and shedding light upon the evolution, the contributions, and the research gaps for each of the six clusters composing the BI body of knowledge. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Analytics; Big data; Business intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Decision support systems; Market intelligence";EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;2040-8269;English;Manage.

Compared with the traditional business intelligence that is based on the firm-owned data and survey data, CrowdBI faces numerous unique issues, such as customer behavior analysis, brand tracking, and product improvement, demand forecasting and trend analysis, competitive intelligence, business popularity analysis and site recommendation, and urban commercial analysis. This paper first characterizes the concept model and unique features and presents a generic framework for CrowdBI. It also investigates novel application areas as well as the key challenges and techniques of CrowdBI.

To achieve a competitive advantage, it is often necessary to listen to and understand what customers are saying about competitors' products and services. Current social media analytics frameworks do not provide benchmarks that allow businesses to compare customer sentiment on social media to easily understand where businesses are doing well and where they need to improve. In this paper, we present a social media competitive analytics framework with sentiment benchmarks that can be used to glean industry-specific marketing intelligence. Based on the idea of the proposed framework, new social media competitive analytics with sentiment benchmarks can be developed to enhance marketing intelligence and to identify specific actionable areas in which businesses are leading and lagging to further improve their customers' experience using customer opinions gleaned from social media. Guided by the proposed framework, an innovative business-driven social media competitive analytics tool named VOZIQ is developed. We use VOZIQ to analyze tweets associated with five large retail sector companies and to generate meaningful business insight reports. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

article;Nuortimo_ Kalle and Harkonen_ Janne;The first wave impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange: Weak signal detection with managerial implications;2021;JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE STUDIES IN BUSINESS;11;2;30-42;null;"University of Turku; University of Oulu";The global pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) came mostly as a surprise and had a major effect on the global economy. This type of major events that can bring societies to nearly a total standstill are difficult to predict but have a significant impact on business activities. Nevertheless, weak signals might be possible to detect beforehand to enable preparation for the impact, both globally and locally. This study analyses the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange by utilising large-scale media analytics. This entails gaining data through media monitoring over the entire duration of the pandemic by applying black-box algorithms and advanced analytics on real cases. The data analysis is carried out to understand the impact of a such global event in general, while aiming to learn from the potential weak signals to enable future market intelligence to prepare for similar events. A social media firestorm scale, similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes or Sapphir-Simpson scale for hurricanes, is utilised to support the analysis and assist in explaining the phenomenon. The results indicate that pandemics and their impact on markets can be studied as a subset of a media firestorms that produce a sharkfin type of pattern in analytics. The findings indicate that early signals from such events are possible to detect by means of media monitoring, and that the stock exchange behaviour is affected. The implications include highlighting the importance of weak signal detection from abundant data to have the possibility to instigate preventive actions and prepare for such events to avoid maximum negative business impact. The early reaction to this type of events requires a very streamlined connection between market intelligence and different business activities.;null;HALMSTAD UNIV, SWEDEN;2001-015X;English;null;null;null;null;null;null;"Covid-19; early signals; Nasdaq Helsinki; signal detection; social media";null;null;null;PO BOX 823, HALMSTAD, 30118, SWEDEN;Nuortimo, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Turku, Turku, Finland.

It offers a basis for entrepreneurial activities, as it helps obtain and analyze market intelligence to extend business opportunities. Based on dynamic capabilities theory, this empirical study conceptualizes and establishes the linkages between cognitive computing capabilities, which is resultant of technology led information aggregation, and processing capabilities and entrepreneurial quality while examining the moderating effect of innovation ambidexterity as a capability of organizations in a comparative analysis of China and India. The findings based on a survey of 300 firms from the two countries, reveal a positive impact of cognitive computing capabilities on entrepreneurial quality in both countries. Innovation ambidexterity is found playing instrumental role in the case of India, but not in China. This study contributes to the understanding of four measures of entrepreneurship quality, i.e. risk-taking propensity, pro-activeness, frequency and innovativeness, from a dynamic capabilities lens in the context of cognitive computing capabilities and provides empirical validation to the established association in a comparative context of China and India.

Here, we establish the dependency of mean values of functional p-norms of `persistence landscapes' on a uniform scaling of the underlying multivariate distribu-tion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that average values of p-norms are decreasing, when the covariance in a system is increasing. To illustrate the complex dependency of these topological features on changes in the variance-covariance matrix, we conduct numerical experiments utilizing bi-variate distributions with known statistical properties. Our results help to explain the puzzling behavior of p-norms derived from daily log-returns of major equity indices on European and US markets at the inception phase of the global financial meltdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In lack of a complete overview of which data are used to assess real -world drug safety and effectiveness outcomes, we aimed to map the outcomes, data sources, and the reporting of outcome quality in recent pharmacoepidemiological studies. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping review of pharmacoepidemiological studies based on Danish registries investigating drug safety and/or effectiveness, published in the period 2018-2019, identified in PubMed and Scopus. Extraction included: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical level 2 code for drug exposures, outcomes, outcome data sources, and quality of outcomes. Results: Of the 210 included studies, 96\% used outcomes categorized as Clinical, 4\% utilized outcomes categorized as Society-related, 5\% used outcomes categorized as Healthcare cost and utilization, and 3\% of the studies applied outcomes categorized as Patient-reported in which the percentages are not mutually exclusive. Diagnosis (66\%) and Mortality (38\%) were the two most utilized subcategories among those categorized as Clinical outcomes. Danish Health Data Authority and Statistics Denmark registries were the most reported outcome data sources (90\%). Ninety-six studies (46\%) reported one or more quality parameters related to their outcomes of interest with accuracy/validity being the most reported parameter (22\%). Conclusion: The Danish registries support a wide range of outcomes. Across therapeutic areas, most studies investigate traditional clinical outcomes of disease and mortality based on data from a small number of available registries. In contrast, clinical and biochemical databases, despite potentially offering outcomes with high responsiveness, and the high-quality social and healthcare cost registries were rarely used as outcome data sources.;null;DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD;1179-1349;English;null;null;null;null;10.2147/CLEP.S341480;null;"pharmacoepidemiology; registries; review; Denmark; drugs";null;null;null;PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND;"Petersen, CT (Corresponding Author), DLI Market Intelligence, Life Sci Insights Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark.

article;Rashid_ Sabrina and Ghose_ Kamal;Organisational culture and the creation of brand identity: retail food branding in new markets;2015;MARKETING INTELLIGENCE \& PLANNING;33;1;fev/19;null;Lincoln University - New Zealand;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between organizational culture and brand identity in the retail food and beverage industry and also to explore how independent retail coffee shops and cafes build their brands. The evolution of coffee drinking in many new markets is following a pattern similar to the one witnessed in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews, field notes, photographs and empirical material was carried out with 15 independent coffee shops and nine franchise coffee shops in Christchurch, New Zealand. In total five different approaches were adopted to provide diverse observations to compliment every angle of the research setting by using triangulation. Findings - The findings from this research reveal that an appropriate brand name helps to ease the process of brand identity creation. The personality of the market leader strongly influences organizational culture, and a constant flow of updated business intelligence plays an important role in creating a distinctive brand identity. Internal marketing and personal values are key to constructing internal culture while the acculturation process plays an important role in developing internal culture and building brand identity. Research limitations/implications - Difficulty in getting participants was a major limitation because many employees/owners declined to take part in the research due to the nature of their work which required full attention to serve customers when the outlet is operating. Originality/value - In previous years, research has focused on interaction between the organization and their customers (Hoeffler, 2003). This study extends previous research by investigating the internal culture of the organization and its relation to brand identity building within the organization.;null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;0263-4503;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/MIP-10-2013-003;null;"Brand identity; Internal organizational culture; Franchise coffee shops (FCS); Independent coffee shops (ICS); Brand acculturation model";null;null;null;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;"Ghose, K (Corresponding Author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Mkt, Christchurch, New Zealand.

Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model is developed through an extensive review of literature. Survey research is conducted to collect the data from respondents. Structural equation modeling is performed to test the model and the hypotheses. Findings - The outcome of the study reveals that the act of impulsive buying is preceded by buying impulse (BI). BI is positively influenced by consumer susceptibility to normative influence and impulsive buying tendency (IBT). SE influences the generation of BI partially mediated by IBT. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited in its generalizability in terms of its geographic location, culture, and the context of product categories. Practical implications - The findings of the study have practical implications in developing marketing communications, merchandising, and personal selling strategies. Originality/value - In view of the contradictory empirical evidences in extant literature regarding the role NA the present study re-examines whether NA influences impulse buying. The study, conducted in the field setting also ascertains the external validity of the findings not tested in the prior research. Furthermore, in light of psychology literature, the relationship between SE and IBT was hypothesized and empirically established in the present study.;null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;0263-4503;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/MIP-02-2015-0037;null;"Self-esteem; Consumer susceptibility to normative influence; Impulsive buying; Negative affect";null;null;null;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;Bandyopadhyay, N (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Management Rohtak, Rohtak, Haryana, India.

article;Ng'endo_ Mary and Nduwimana_ Julien and Villanueva_ Donald and Demont_ Matty;How Can Pairing Quantitative With Qualitative Data Collection Methods Better Elicit Rice Varietal Selection? Evidence From Burundi;2023;SAGE OPEN;13;4;null;null;"CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)";Participatory Varietal Selection (PVS) is the selection by stakeholders of varieties in advanced testing stages by plant breeding programs. With Burundi as a case example, this study incorporated qualitative Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) into the quantitative PVS structure so as to elicit deeper insights into rice trait preferences and illuminate broader issues affecting rice farmers. During two consecutive years, this study surveyed 174 participants across six stakeholder groups (administrators, farmers, custom millers, researchers, seed producers, and traders) in three locations. There were statistically significant associations in rice trait preferences across locations, participating stakeholders, and genders, highlighting preference alignment. Moreover, multiple traits were desired simultaneously, beyond productivity-related traits, and sometimes contradicting researchers' preferences, especially in rainfed systems. By moving beyond quantitative PVS preference scores as being the only way of gathering trait preference data, this study has shown how the incorporation of qualitative FGDs into the PVS structure can elicit deeper insights on trait preferences and illuminate broader issues affecting rice farmers, which when solved can accelerate the momentum in widespread adoption of new rice varieties. Eliciting rice varietal preferences in BurundiThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate the power of pairing quantitative with qualitative data collection methods to elicit rice varietal preferences in Burundi. By combining FGDs with PVS, we show the multiple traits desired, beyond production-related traits, and sometimes contradicting breeders' preferences. With the key limitation and areas for improvement hinging on the need for more robust quantitative PVS that goes beyond binary scores as well as the need for more time-efficient FGDs by use of local language that reduces translation times, it is more feasible to move beyond quantitative PVS preference scores as being the only way of gathering trait preference data. This study has shown how the incorporation of qualitative FGDs into the PVS structure can elicit deeper insights on trait preferences and illuminate broader issues affecting rice farmers, which when solved can accelerate the momentum in widespread adoption of new rice varieties.;null;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;2158-2440;English;null;null;null;null;10.1177/21582440231218579;null;"PVS; rice; gender; irrigation; rainfed; Burundi";null;null;OCT;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;"Ng'endo, M (Corresponding Author), Int Rice Res Inst IRRI, POB 30709-00100,Old Naivasha Rd,Off Waiyaki Way, Nairobi, Kenya.

This has resulted in a proliferation of fragmented literature duplicating identical endeavors. Although such pluralism expands the understanding of the idiosyncrasies of BI conceptualizations, attributes and characteristics, it cannot cumulate existing contributions to better advance the BI body of knowledge. In response, this study aims to provide an integrative framework that integrates the interrelationships across the BI process and its organizational context and outlines the covered research areas and the underexplored ones. Design/methodology/approach This paper reviews 120 articles spanning the course of 35 years of research on BI process, antecedents and outcomes published in top tier ABS ranked journals. Findings Building on a process framework, this review identifies major patterns and contradictions across eight dimensions, namely, environmental antecedents; organizational antecedents; managerial and individual antecedents; BI process; strategic outcomes; firm performance outcomes; decision-making; and organizational intelligence. Finally, the review pinpoints to gaps in linkages across the BI process, its antecedents and outcomes for future researchers to build upon. Practical implications This review carries some implications for practitioners and particularly the role they ought to play should they seek actionable intelligence as an outcome of the BI process. Across the studies this review examined, managerial reluctance to open their intelligence practices to close examination was omnipresent. Although their apathy is understandable, due to their frustration regarding the lack of measurability of intelligence constructs, managers manifestly share a significant amount of responsibility in turning out explorative and descriptive studies partly due to their defensive managerial participation. Interestingly, managers would rather keep an ineffective BI unit confidential than open it for assessment in fear of competition or bad publicity. Therefore, this review highlights the value open participation of managers in longitudinal studies could bring to the BI research and by extent the new open intelligence culture across their organizations where knowledge is overt, intelligence is participative, not selective and where double loop learning alongside scholars is continuous. Their commitment to open participation and longitudinal studies will help generate new research that better integrates the BI process within its context and fosters new measures for intelligence performance. Originality/value This study provides an integrative framework that integrates the interrelationships across the BI process and its organizational context and outlines the covered research areas and the underexplored ones. By so doing, the developed framework sets the ground for scholars to further develop insights within each dimension and across their interrelationships.";null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;2040-8269;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/MRR-07-2020-0386;null;"Business intelligence; Literature review; Synthesis; Process; Antecedents; Outcomes";null;null;MAY 7;Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;"Talaoui, Y (Corresponding Author), Univ Vaasa, Sch Management, Vaasa, Finland.

The study examines the relationship of object and social psychological stimuli with utilitarian and hedonic attitude and intentions to purchase counterfeit apparel products. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collected data from 331 systematically selected university students of the age bracket (18-30) years from Punjab, Pakistan (MLE) via self-administrated questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation via AMOS 23 was used for data analysis. Findings - The modified S-O-R model explained significant variance in counterfeit purchase intentions. Hedonic attitude proved to be a strong predictor of counterfeit apparel purchase intentions as compared to utilitarian attitude. All attributes of counterfeit apparel products proved to be the significant positive predictors of hedonic and utilitarian attitude except information susceptibility, which did not predict utilitarian attitude. Research limitations/implications - Data were collected from university students of the age bracket (18-30) years and apparel products were taken as a product category. Practical implications - The retailers and manufacturers of original brands should emphasize humiliation and embarrassment that a consumer may have to face because of counterfeit purchasing. They can also educate consumers on the negative impacts of the counterfeit products not only on consumers but also on the economy as a whole. Originality/value - S-O-R model was adapted to provide strong theoretical underpinnings to understand counterfeit consumption behavior. This study also incorporated two dimensions of attitude in counterfeit product consumption behavior and analyzed their relative influence on purchase intentions.;null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;0263-4503;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/MIP-11-2017-0272;null;"Apparel products; Counterfeit products; Hedonic attitude; S-O-R model; Utilitarian attitude";null;null;null;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;Moon, MA (Corresponding Author), Air Univ, Sch Management, Mkt, Multan, Pakistan.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,025 executives were surveyed about their companies' usage of competitive intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination as well as their perception concerning certain organizational characteristics. Findings - This research develops and tests intelligence as a precedent to marketing strategy formulation, revealing multiple phases and contributing aspects within the process. It also discovers that the practice of competitive intelligence, while strong in the area of information collection, is weak from a process and analytical perspective. Research limitations/implications - While the sample was indeed a census of Canadian technology firms, care must be taken in generalizing the study beyond this industry, and certainly beyond the Canadian borders. Also, the questionnaire used only dichotomous variables (yes/no answers), which limited the testing that could be done. Practical implications - Using these results, competitive intelligence departments and professionals can improve efficacy within their approach and execution strategies. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is two-fold. It reveals many of the ``state-of-the-art{''} levels of practice within current competitive intelligence efforts, and it proposes a model of the intelligence process.;null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED;0309-0566;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/03090560810877141;null;"marketing intelligence; competitive strategy; strategic marketing; Canada; decision making";null;null;null;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;Dishman, PL (Corresponding Author), Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Management, Provo, UT 84602 USA.

article;Cheah_ Isaac and Phau_ Ian;Effects of ``owned by{''} versus ``made in{''} for willingness to buy Australian brands;2015;MARKETING INTELLIGENCE \& PLANNING;33;3;444-468;null;"Curtin University; Curtin University";"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of economic nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism in the form of country of origin (COO) cues specifically ``Made in {[} ... ]{''} and ``Owned by [} ... ]{''} on the product judgement of bi-national wine brands (brands with multiple country affiliations). Further, the role of consumer product knowledge is examined as a moderator of these xenophobia attitudes. Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered questionnaire was designed using established scales. A convenience sample was drawn from participants attending a major wine trade exhibition in Western Australia and university students. A variety of statistical techniques were used to analyse the data. Findings - High levels of economic nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment was so strong that respondents did not want products that had any association with a foreign country, regardless of whether the products are directly or indirectly related to a foreign origin. This suggests that Australian consumers are not any more receptive to bi-national brands; as such domestic affiliations have not diluted the economic nationalistic sentiment. Further, results confirm that Australian consumers use COO cues as part of wine evaluations. Consumers with low product knowledge are likely to rely on extrinsic country cues to reinforce their brand evaluation, whereas consumers who are more knowledgeable are found to base evaluations on intrinsic attributes rather than extrinsic cues. Research limitations/implications - Only respondents from Perth, Western Australia were chosen, thus limiting the representativeness of the sample. Other cultural contexts and product categories based on a larger sample size should be investigated in the future. Practical implications - This research provides useful consumer insights and new market entry implications in terms of advertising and branding strategies for international wine manufacturers and distributors who wish to expand globally. In addition, there are managerial implications for domestic market where local retailers, merchandisers, importers can avoid importing products originating from offending countries and take on opportunity to exploit and promote ``buy domestic campaigns{'' Originality/value - Conceptually, this study extends the existing COO literature by introducing bi-national brands into the model; expanding on country of ownership appeals in evaluating bi-national brands; and identifying the correlation between the economic nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism constructs. Further, this research can significantly help wine marketers to develop more effective positioning strategies. It will also help in the development of pricing and promotional decisions.";null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;0263-4503;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/MIP-01-2014-0016;null;"Country of origin; Ownership; Australian brands; Consumer ethnocentrism";null;null;null;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;Phau, I (Corresponding Author), Curtin Univ, Sch Mkt, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.

Therefore, comprehending the dynamics of AR adoption is essential if retailers are to successfully encourage customers to embrace this extremely innovative form of technology. As a result, the authors propose and evaluate a more comprehensive model, consisting of the task-technology fit (TTF) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTUAT2) models, for use in low-income countries.Design/methodology/approachThe present research uses variance-based partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using WarpPLS.7 to examine 398 responses from Egyptian retail consumers.FindingsTTF, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating condition (FC), hedonic motivation (HM) and customer innovativeness (CI) positively affect shoppers' behavioral intentions (BI) to adopt AR Apps in retail, while perceived risk (PR) negatively affects BI.Originality/valueThe current study is the first to investigate the determinants of shoppers' BI toward AR Apps adoption in the retail context using UTAUT2 and TTF models.;null;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;0263-4503;English;null;null;null;null;10.1108/MIP-03-2023-0112;null;"Augmented reality; Task-technology fit (TTF); UTUAT2; Behavioral intentions; Retail";null;null;jul/07;Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;"Elsotouhy, MM (Corresponding Author), Mansoura Univ, Fac Commerce, Dept Business Adm, Mansoura, Egypt.

To do so correctly there is a need for a comprehensive model that, in addition to eliminating the defects of the previous models, describes the phases and indicators and also illustrates the relationship between them. This research meets such a need and presents a developed model. The ongoing research is based on a mixed approach. The meta-synthesis method was used to identify the initial model in the first stage and the delphi method was used to validate and modify the initial model, as well as to understand the relationship between all the phases of this process in the second stage. Two samples were used, the first included all the papers in the competitive intelligence field, of which 45 were selected. The second sample included experts in intelligence. Organizations can use this comprehensive model for deployment, correct implementation, and the practice of competitive intelligence.;null;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;0740-8188;English;null;null;null;null;10.1016/j.lisr.2020.101004;null;null;null;null;APR;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;"Sanatjoo, A (Corresponding Author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Educ Sci \& Psychol, Dept Knowldge \& Informat Sci, Azadi Sq, Mashhad 9177948974, Razavi Khorasan, Iran.

In this scenario, it is imperative that organizations use Intelligence, which is understood as a process of gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating high-value data and information at the right time for use in the decision-making process. Earlier, the concept of Intelligence was associated with the military and national security sector; however, in present times, and as organizations evolve, Intelligence has been defined in several ways for the purposes of different applications. Given that the purpose of Intelligence is to obtain real value from data, information, and the dynamism of the organizations, the study of this discipline provides an opportunity to analyze the core trends related to data collection and processing, information management, decision-making process, and organizational capabilities. Therefore, the present study makes a conceptual analysis of the existing definitions of intelligence in the literature by quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, identifying the main authors and research areas, and evaluating the development of the field using SciMAT as a bibliometric analysis software.";null;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;0268-4012;English;null;null;null;null;10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.013;null;"Business Intelligence; Competitive Intelligence; Strategic Intelligence; Science information management; Mapping analysis";null;null;OCT;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;"López-Robles, JR (Corresponding Author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Graph Design \& Engn Projects, Alameda Urquijo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain.
